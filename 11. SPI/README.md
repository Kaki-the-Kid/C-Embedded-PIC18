# SPI signals 
## The SPI bus specifies four logic signals. 
* SCLK - Serial Clock (output from master) 
*  MOSI - Master Output, Slave Input (output from master) 
*  MISO - Master Input, Slave Output (output from slave) 
* SS - Slave Select (active low; output from master) 

<b>Alternative naming conventions</b> 
* SCK, CLK - Serial Clock (output from master) 
*  SDI, DI, SI - Serial Data In 
* SDO, DO, SO - Serial Data Out 
* SSEL - Slave Select

1. The master pulls the slave select low and then issues clock cycles. 
2. The clock frequency is not specified in the SPI protocol and can be anything from 0 up to 70MHz depending on the characteristics of the slave device. 
3. The data transfer then takes place. 
4. The master then de-selects the slave.

## Basic serial data transfer

The registers within the master and slave act like shift registers shifting one bit on every cycle of the SCLK.

## Data transfer details 
* Most SPI interfaces have two configuration bits, called clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA). 
* CPOL determines whether the shift clock's idle state is low (CPOL=O) or high (CPOL=1 ) . 
* CPHA determines on which clock edges data is shifted in and out (for CPHA=O, MOSI data is shifted out on falling edge, M ISO data is shifted in on rising edge). 
* As each bit has two states, this allows for four different combinations, all of which are incompatible with each other. 
* For two SPI devices to talk to each other, they need to be set to use the same clock polarity and phase settings.

## SPI Data Transfer Modes
* These four modes are the combinations of CPOL and CPHA. 
* Modes 0 and 3 are the most common. 
* With SPI modes 0 and 3, data is always latched in on the rising edge of SCK and always output on the falling edge of SCK.

## Multiple Slaves
 If multiple slave devices exist, the master normally generates a separate slave select signal for each slave. - Star connection.

## SPI Bus characteristics 
* It is up to the master and slave devices to know whether a received byte is meaningful or not. 
* So a device must discard the received byte in a ''transmit only'' frame or generate a dummy byte for a ''receive only'' frame. 
* No Acknowledgement 
* Master doesn't even know if slave is present! 
* Slaves can be thought of as 10 devices of the master.
